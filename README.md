# This was experimental branch of Caffe for OpenCL, we know recommend you use the now official OpenCL port of Caffe in BVLC GitHub Repo at https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/opencl


### OpenCL Caffe Experimental branch by AMD Reserach- No new development is happing on it. 

This is an OpenCL implementation of Caffe, a mainstream DNN framework (https://github.com/BVLC/caffe). It includes a largely complete Caffe feature set as of August 2015. The project is under active development to improve performance and add new features. Contributions from the community are welcome.

OpenCL (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL) is an open standard parallel programming language for heterogeneous platforms. OpenCL is supported by a variety of commercial chip manufacturers. 

#### Branches
 We have three branches in this repo.
 
 -stable, the stable branch for users
 
 -dev, the developer branch, we encourage people to contribute on this branch
 
 -master, the original Caffe's master branch against which our code is synchronized.
 
#### Design features
  -All Caffe layers ported to OpenCL

  -Performance improvement by batched implementation for conv layer based on clBLAS

  -The user can choose the optimal batch number depending on H/W properties, image size and minibatch size

  -Supports OpenCL 2.0, 1.2
  
  -Implemented in C++ and OpenCL, maintaining the same interfaces as the original Caffe

  -Users can directly run DNN models: AlexNet, VGG-16 and VGG-19

Note: More features are planned in the near future. Currently this implementation has been verified and tuned on AMD devices (CPUs/GPUs/APUs). Compatibility across different chip manufacturers will be considered for future addition.

#### Performance

We intend to keep updating the latest performance as we make optimizations. Fury results are preliminary and are actively being improved.

### Original Caffe information
##### Caffe

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.
